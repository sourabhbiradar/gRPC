# file streaming using gRPC

This code demonstrate how fast files can be shared using gRPC

add perhaps 1GB , 2GB+ size of files to this folder
update `path` in client.go

And check how fast the files were sent & received.

NOTE : GitHub doesnt allow to upload large files to repo ,So do it on your PC.
